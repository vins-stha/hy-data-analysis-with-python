"""
Create a function file_count that gets a filename as parameter and returns a triple of numbers. The function should
 read the file, count the number of lines, words, and characters in the file, and return a triple with these count
  in this order. You get division into words by splitting at whitespace. You donâ€™t have to remove punctuation.

Part 2.

Create a main function that in a loop calls file_count using each filename in the list of command line parameters 
sys.argv[1:] as a parameter, in turn. For call python3 src/file_count file1 file2 ... the output should be

?      ?       ?       file1
?      ?       ?       file2
...
The fields are separated by tabs (\t). The fields are in order: linecount, wordcount, charactercount, filename.
